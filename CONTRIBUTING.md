# How to contribute

Hey, thanks for being here! Thanks for thinking about contributing to this project! 

Here are some important resources that can help you:

  * [How features work](https://medium.com/@anhvouw/imitating-nyer-todays-realistic-swipe-deck-with-react-native-animation-65ae04915c15) How this library works, going over a few key features.

## Submitting changes

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Readability is what we strive for! 

  * We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)

Thanks,
Anh Vo
